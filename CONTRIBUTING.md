## Code of Conduct

The Fantasy Statblocks Code of Conduct [governs these project and everyone participating in it](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to and agreeing to uphold this code.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues/).
- Code your issue appropriately with one of the four labels. When in doubt, use 'bug'.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you are running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of Obsidian, including that you have installer version 1.1.9 or newer.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions or have plugin interactions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Obsidian Discord) to see if users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Error Codes (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the Obsidianl, Plugin, how you installed it, your other plugins, and what else you think seems relevant.
- Possibly a copy of your `note.md` and the possibly the plugin's `data.json` file.
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues/new) and select the Bug Template.
- Clearly explain the expected behavior and the actual behavior. 
- Provide as much context as possible, including reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This should include your code, and for better bug reports, isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. 
- Include any relevant information you collected previously. 
- Answer all questions on the issue template as accurately as possible.

After submitting your bug report, our team will take the following steps:

- Label the issue according to its severity.
- Attempt to reproduce the issue using the steps provided. If the issue cannot be reproduced, we may ask you for additional information and mark the issue as ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù.
- If the issue can be reproduced, it will be re-prioritized and possibly have other tags added, and left for [someone](#your-first-code-contribution) to implement the solution.

##### The current version of the Bug Template Issue is below:

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Fantasy Statblocks, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers, and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of Obsidian, including that you have installer version 1.1.9 or newer.
- Read the [documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It is up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the most of our users and not just a small subset. If you are just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library to be added in.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks/issues).

- Ensure that the issue title is clear and descriptive, accurately reflecting the suggestion being made.
- Provide a detailed step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement, including as much relevant information as possible.
- Clearly state the current behavior, and explain what behavior you expected to see instead and why. You may also wish to mention any alternatives that have been considered.
- Consider including screenshots or animated GIFs to demonstrate the steps or highlight the relevant part of the project. Tools such as LiceCap (for macOS and Windows) or Silentcast and Byzanz (for Linux) may be helpful. (Note: this only applies if the project has a GUI.)
- Explain how the suggested enhancement would benefit most Fantasy Statblocks users. You may also want to provide examples of other projects that have successfully implemented similar features for inspiration.

```

### Improving The Documentation
- Do you see any areas of documentation that are unclear?
- Do you think there is a section that you want to expand on?
- Do you want to add a funny note, a song or a sarcastic vibe?

Create a [[Github Policies|Github Issue]] in the appropriate documentation repository stating what you think should change. If you are creating an Issue on how you would like to contribute, please include two sample paragraphs of your writing.

- **1st Sample**: *Narrative/Storytelling Writing*. Much of the documentation mixes between using metaphor and analogy to explain concepts that would otherwise not be perceived as beginner-friendly.
- **2nd Sample**: *Technical Writing*. In certain cases, we do revert to Technical Writing, which is formalized and micromanaged. When writing in this way, anyone can perform these steps and reach the result.

Both can be freestyle. It could at first be a storytelling guide about how to cook, and then a very technical recipe about making a good sandwich. Have fun with it. These samples are not a test or to judge, but an ***introduction to you***. We will never say no to help.

## Styleguides
### Commit Messages
