# Code of Conduct - Fantasy Statblocks

## Our Commitment

As contributors and maintainers of Fantasy Statblocks, we are committed to creating and maintaining an open and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

To create a positive environment for our community, we ask that all participants uphold the following standards:

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards others.
- Recognize that individuals have differing opinions and viewpoints, and that respectful communication is necessary to work towards a common goal.
- Provide and receive constructive feedback in a respectful and constructive manner. We don't tolerate personal attacks or other forms of harassment.
- Show patience and understanding when teaching or learning.
- Keep in mind the overarching goals of the Table Top Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Nagging, badgering, begging, or otherwise pestering maintainers and would-be contributors for a response to an issue or pull request.
- Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks.
- Engaging in any form of harassment, whether in public or private.
- Publishing others' private information, such as their physical or email address, without their consent.
- Engaging in other actions designed to harm, intimidate or exclude individuals or groups of people. For example, attempting to introduce features that are completely inaccessible to non-SRD DnD players.

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we're responsible for upholding and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. We will take appropriate and corrective action in response to any behavior that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

We've the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct. We will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces associated with Javalent, including Discord.
It applies when a person is also representing the community in any official capacity.
For instance, as when as in other GitHub repositories in which you are invoking Javalents' plugins.

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience any abusive, harassing, or, otherwise unacceptable behavior in our community, please report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/932707309195493416). You may message LittleMaelstrom#6794 or javalent
#3452. If we're unavailable, you may also notify sklore#8618.

All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated by the community leaders.

We take all reports of Code of Conduct violations seriously,
and community leaders respect the privacy and security of reporters, no matter the incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

When determining the consequences of any action that violates this Code of Conduct, community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use inappropriate language or other behavior deemed intentionally inflammatory or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: Community leaders issue a private, written warning that provides clarity around the nature of the violation, and an explanation of why the behavior is inappropriate. They may request a public apology sometimes.

2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
   of actions.

**Result**: A written warning from community leaders, with clear
expectations for behavior going forward. Continued violation of the Code of Conduct may result in further consequences, including temporary or permanent bans.

3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Seriously, you need to keep intentionally violating the CoC to get here.

**Result**: A temporary ban from participating in any community activities or public communication with the community for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like #Javalent-Support-Thread in Discord. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of disregarding community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment or aggression toward or disparagement of individuals. At this point, you're absolutely showing disregard for any social decorum to get here.

**Result**: A permanent ban from participating in any community activities or public interaction with the community. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like #Javalent-Support-Thread in Discord.
